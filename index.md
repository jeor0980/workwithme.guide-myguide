## Values

- Accountability
- Honesty
- Humor

## Personality

Extroverted introvert, usually pretty direct person.

## Work Patterns

- 9:00AM - 5:00PM Mountain Time

- Working remotely from Broomfield, CO

- I prefer work on my code/programming tasks in the morning, meetings in the afternoon. 


## Communication Preferences

Slack is the fastest way to reach me and great for quick questions. 

Send me a calendar invite if you need to meet with me over a video call, make sure to include the subject and/or issue and end goal of what we're talking about.

You can also email me but response time will be a day or two so depending on my workload.

I try not to check slack and email after hours unless I am on-call.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

Either super short on my responses or swearing

### How to help

If I'm not feeling great I'll most likely ask to exit a meeting or take some time off to recover if I'm stressed. Send me good music.

## Me Being Me

Terrbile puns

## Pet Peeves

- Being late to scheduled meetings without notice
- Meetings without agendas
- Slack mentions with only "hey"

## Career Goals & Future Interests

All things related to running and hosting a high availability, globally distributed CMS hosting platform. Getting better at bass, guitar and drums.
